    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <strong>gyro</strong> <em>(YEE-row)</em> is a classic Greek dish, with the meat traditionally cooked on a vertical spit and shaved off in individual servings. While this delicious method for preparing meat is often used in Greek restaurants, it's not easy to accomplish at home. This Greek-American take on the dish uses ground lamb or beef and is quick and easy to make in a home kitchen.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Meat Mixture:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground lamb, or beef</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced red onion</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>Oil, for grilling or frying, as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Sandwich:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 rounds flatbread, or pita</li>
        <li>4 leaves lettuce</li>
        <li>1 medium tomato, sliced or diced</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Tzatziki sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>To make the meat mixture, thoroughly combine the ground lamb, salt, black pepper, cumin, nutmeg, oregano, garlic, red onion, and lemon juice in a mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Divide into four equal portions and shape into oblong patties about 3-inch wide by 6-inch long by 1/2-inch thick. Notice that the patty is shaped more like a sausage (long and thin) rather than a hamburger patty. This is intentional, to ensure the patty fits in the flatbread. Refrigerate for one hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill or grill pan over high heat. Alternatively, heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat.</li>
        <li>If grilling, brush the grill or grill pan with oil. If pan-frying, add a dollop of oil to the pan. Grill or pan-fry the patties for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until cooked through with crispy edges.</li>
        <li>To assemble the sandwiches, spread tzatziki sauce down in the center of a flatbread round or the pocket of the pita.</li>
        <li>Add a lettuce leaf, some sliced tomato, and a few thin onion slices.</li>
        <li>Add the patty and fold the bread over the lamb. Repeat with the remaining sandwiches. Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
